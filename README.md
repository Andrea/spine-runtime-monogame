spine-runtime-monogame
======================

A runtime for spine for use with MonoGame.

A near as possible copy of the official libgdx run-time.

I created this repository because the official 'Generic C#' runtime is not yet available and I wanted to get something running in MonoGame ASAP :)
Also the best way to learn the run-time is probably to jump straight in and try developing one.

I imagine that as soon as the official c# runtime is available that I will no longer require this.
