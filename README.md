spine-runtime-monogame
======================

A runtime for spine for use with MonoGame.

I created this repository because the official 'Generic C#' runtime is not yet available and I wanted to get something running in MonoGame ASAP :)
Also the best way to learn the run-time is probably to jump straight in and try developing one.
